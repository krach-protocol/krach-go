# Verifpal 

[VerifPal](https://verifpal.com/) is a new modeling language that can verify and analyze the secure implementation of cryptographic protocols.
[Krach](../README.md) is based on Noise framework to create a secure protocol for IoT and this is an effort to formelly verify its security.

First let's try to understand the principals (aka, actors or anythings engaging in activity other than the attacker). 
We have the `initiator` (or the client) which initiate the communication as the name suggest and we the `responder` (or the server)
